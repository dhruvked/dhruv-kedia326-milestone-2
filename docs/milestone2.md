        <h2>Application Idea</h2>
        The main idea for my application is to help students with one of the most challenging concepts(at least for me) to grasp in Mathematics. The line equation. My idea is to use html css tools to create a enviroment where learners can interact with the graph and the line on it to understannd how 2 points on the graph make a line and determine the slope or how the slope make a line with one given point. I will try and apply all the concepts learnt in the course till now as well as the future topics mainly relating to interaction with the database.

        <h2>Functionality</h2>
        I am thinking of using html canvas to create the grid to help learners interact with differennt components of the graph and the line. I would like ensure any two points on the graph make a line. Also I would like to ensure there are input boxes that display the ,y-intercept and the slope of the line as well as a table of all the points the linen goes through. I can create a store button so that the user can store the line with the values of y-intercept and the slope in order for them access the line in the future. Of course this is a rough idea because i havent worked with storing annd interacting with data on web apps.
